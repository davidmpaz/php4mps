# PHP implementation for MPS 

Language is built mainly taking into account grammar used [here](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser/blob/3.x/grammar/php7.y) as
documentation. Other related projects are used as well as support materials, [php-ast](https://github.com/nikic/php-ast) and
[php antlr](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/php/PhpParser.g4).

## Goal

Provider support for PHP language inside MPS platform. In other words, what the BaseLanguage is for Java.
